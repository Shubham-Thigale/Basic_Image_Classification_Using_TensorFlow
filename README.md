# Project Title: MNIST Classification with TensorFlow

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of TensorFlow to build a machine learning model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train a neural network, and evaluate its performance.

## Features

- **Data Import and Exploration**: Loading the MNIST dataset and inspecting its structure and dimensions.
- **Data Visualization**: Plotting example images to understand the data distribution.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Applying one-hot encoding to convert class labels into a machine-readable format.
- **Model Training**: Building and training a neural network using TensorFlow.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assessing the model's accuracy and visualizing predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
